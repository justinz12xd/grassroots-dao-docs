## 🧭 About this DAO

Grassroots DAO is a collaborative initiative that lies at the intersection of empathy, nature, and technology.  
We aim to archive and circulate small local practices, nurturing large-scale regenerative change over time.

> 📝 This repository serves as a "web-like top page" to share our vision, documents, and project updates.

## 🌍 Our Goals

- Ecological regeneration (e.g., fireflies, native plants, natural springs)
- Archiving local wisdom (e.g., traditional foods, skills, lived experiences)
- Building a decentralized empathy-driven support and economic network
